<h1><b>üìöAbout</b></h1>
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.


<h1><b>üìúProblem Statement</b></h1>
Danny wants to get insights about pizza metrics , pattern in orders, runner and customer experience, effect of including or excluding ingredient from receipe,price and rating for pizza. This insights will help him  better direct his runners , increase his profits,Optimize Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

<h1><b>üìå‚ùìCase Study Questions</b></h1>

## A. Pizza Metrics
- How many pizzas were ordered?
- How many unique customer orders were made?
- How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
- How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
- How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
- What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
- For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
- How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
- What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
- What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

## B. Runner and Customer Experience
- How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
- What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
- Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
- What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
- What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
- What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
- What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## C. Ingredient Optimisation
- What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
- What was the most commonly added extra?
- What was the most common exclusion?
- Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
  1.Meat Lovers
  2.Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
  3.Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
  4.Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
- Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
   For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
- What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

## D. Pricing and Ratings
- If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
- What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?Add cheese is $1 extra
- The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset  generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
- Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
 1.customer_id
 2.order_id
 3.runner_id
 4.rating
 5.order_time
 6.pickup_time
 7.Time between order and pickup
 8.Delivery duration
 9.Average speed
10.Total number of pizzas
- If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

Danny has shared with  6 interconnected datasets for this case study
	
1.`customer_orders`
2.`runner_orders`
3.`runners`
4.`pizza_names`
5.`pizza_toppings`
6.`pizza_recipes`

## Table#1 - customer_orders

**1.Get a preview of the ``customer_orders`` table.**
 ```sql
 SELECT * 
 FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
 LIMIT 10;
```
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time               |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------ |

```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
| count |

| 14    |


```sql
 SELECT
      table_name,
      column_name,
      data_type,
      column_default,
      is_nullable
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = 'customer_orders';
```
| table_name      | column_name | data_type                   | column_default | is_nullable |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| customer_orders | order_id    | integer                     |                | YES         |
| customer_orders | customer_id | integer                     |                | YES         |

**Observation**
	
The pizza_id relates to the type of pizza which was ordered whilst the exclusions are the ingredient_id values which should be removed from the pizza and the extras are the ingredient_id values which need to be added to the pizza.The exclusions and extras columns will need to be cleaned up.Customer order table contains 14 records.

**Cleaning customer_orders**
	
Here i am updating null values to be empty(NULL) to indicate customers ordered no extras/exclusions. The string`null is updated to empty(NULL). Ideally this columns should have defalut value as 0.
	
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cleaned_customer_orders;
CREATE TEMP TABLE cleaned_customer_orders AS (

**Cleaning runner_orders**
	
km and minutes needs to be removed. for that using   REGEXP_REPLACE  which returns a new string with the substrings, which match a regular expression pattern, replaced by a new substring.The NULLIF function returns NULL if and only if value1 and value2 are equal. Otherwise it returns value1. so using NULLIF.
cleaning pickuptime which had `null` string in it.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cleaned_runner_orders;	
CREATE TEMP TABLE cleaned_runner_orders AS (
      SELECT
        order_id,
        runner_id,
        CASE
          WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN null
          ELSE pickup_time
        END :: timestamp AS pickup_time,
        
        NULLIF(REGEXP_REPLACE(distance, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'), '') :: numeric AS distance,
        NULLIF(REGEXP_REPLACE(duration, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'), '') :: numeric AS duration,
        
        CASE
          WHEN cancellation IN ('null', 'NaN', '') THEN null
          ELSE cancellation
        END AS cancellation
      FROM
        pizza_runner.runner_orders

Seeing the trends it seem the Average speed for the area is 35-45.In order to deliver pizza fast , runner id 2 is speeding. 

**7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
	
This is not right to attribute for successful delivery to runners as order cancellations are out of the runner‚Äôs control.
 ```sql
 SELECT 
      runner_id, 
      ROUND(100 * SUM(
        CASE WHEN distance is null THEN 0
        ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS success_perc
    FROM pizza_runner.cleaned_runner_orders
    
    GROUP BY runner_id
    order by runner_id;
```
| runner_id | success_perc |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 100          |
| 2         | 75           |
