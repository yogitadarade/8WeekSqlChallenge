<h1><b>üìöAbout</b></h1>

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

<h1><b>üìúProblem Statement</b></h1>

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

<h1><b> üìå‚ùìCase Study Questions</b></h1>

These are the questions that were provided:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

<h1><b>üïµÔ∏è‚ÄçUnderstand  and Explore Data</b></h1>
Danny provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues. He also provided an entity-relationship diagram (ERD).

![erd danny diner](ERD.png)

There are 3 tables in the ERD:

- ``sales``
- ``menu``
-  ``members``

## Table#1 - sales

**1.Get a preview of the ``sales`` table.**
```sql
SELECT
  	* 
FROM dannys_diner.sales
LIMIT 5;
```
| customer_id | order_date               | product_id |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 1          |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-07T00:00:00.000Z | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-10T00:00:00.000Z | 3          |
| A           | 2021-01-11T00:00:00.000Z | 3          |

**Observation**
This table contains  ``customer_id`` and product they purchased on a given  ``order_date``.

``COUNT`` number of records in the sale table

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS count_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales;
```

| count_sales |
|-------------|
| 15          |


**Observation**
There were a total of 15 sales in the ``sales`` table.

**2. Check Datatypes, default values, and if the columns can contains null records**
 This table was created with the script and we have access to ERD , but it is good practice to check the datatypes before move ahead which questions
 ```sql   
    SELECT
      table_name,
      column_name,
      data_type,
     column_default,
     is_nullable
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'sales';
```

| table_name | column_name | data_type         | column_default | is_nullable |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| sales      | order_date  | date              |  null          | YES         |
| sales      | product_id  | integer           |  null          | YES         |
| sales      | customer_id | character varying |  null          | YES         |

**Observation**
Columns can contain null values

**3. Check for any null values in columns**
```sql
 SELECT *  
 FROM dannys_diner.sales
 WHERE customer_id IS NULL or
 order_date IS NULL or product_id IS NULL
 ```
**Observation**
No null values were found

## Table#2 - menu

**1.Get a preview of the ``menu`` table.**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM dannys_diner.menu
LIMIT 5;
```
| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | sushi        | 10    |
| 2          | curry        | 15    |
| 3          | ramen        | 12    |

**Observation**
This table contains all the dishes with their prices, that are sold in the diner. 
The ``menu`` table is linked to the previous ``sales`` table via the ``product_id``.

**2. Check Datatypes, default values, and if the columns can contains null records**

```sql
   SELECT
      table_name,
      column_name,
      data_type,
     column_default,
     is_nullable
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'menu';
```
| table_name | column_name  | data_type         | column_default | is_nullable |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| menu       | product_id   | integer           |   null         | YES         |

| menu       | product_name | character varying |   null         | YES         |

**Observation**
Columns can contain null values

**3. Check for any null values in columns**
```sql
    SELECT
    FROM  dannys_diner.menu
    WHERE product_id IS NULL OR
    price IS NULL OR
    product_name IS NULL ;
 ```
**Observation**
No null values were found


## Table #3 - members 
**1.Get a preview of the ``menu`` table.**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dannys_diner.members 
LIMIT 5;
```
| customer_id | join_date  |
|-------------|------------|
| A           | 2021-01-07 |
